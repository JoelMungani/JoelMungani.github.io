# About Me

## My Interests
*My name is Joel Mungani, I am 20 years old. I live my life for Jesus; He is my everything. Romans 8:18.*  
*I enjoy reading the Bible and preaching the Gospel, fulfilling the Great Commission that Jesus commanded us to follow as His disciples.*

## Websites I Recommend
- [Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com) - *I love using this website when I read Scripture on my computer. It helps me out a lot, as it provides access to various translations and resources to deepen my understanding of the Bible.*
- [YouVersion Bible App](https://www.bible.com) - *This website allows you to download the Bible and offers a daily verse of the day. It also provides daily devotionals, which are great for spiritual growth. I highly recommend it for anyone looking to strengthen their faith.*
